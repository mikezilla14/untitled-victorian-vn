## Verdict

**PASS**

Promotion draft matches the promoted Day 2 spine, stat intents, and flag whitelists. Divergent merges are flavour-only; no structural drift from `story_board.md`.

## Canon cross-reference

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Story board spine (labels, menus, flags) | OK — Morning contraband → afternoon REFLECT → evening crisis → night WRITE |
| Day 1 carry-in (`day1_corridor_state`, `visit_missy`, Ch1) | OK — branches and callbacks present |
| Contraband (`stolen_wearing` / `planted_in_trunk`) | OK — predator vs prey/ghost split |
| Tea crisis (`day2_tea_choice` prey/predator/ghost) | OK — three arms + Gideon reactions |
| Missy trust (`missy_day2_suspicion_state`, `missy_day2_trust_break`) | OK |
| Manuscript gates (Ch1 catch-up 15, Ch2 30) | OK — `has_story_fuel` thresholds |

## Stat-story alignment

| Beat | Draft | Promoted baseline | OK |
|------|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Stolen contraband | susp=5, corr=15 | Same | Yes |
| Planted contraband | insp=5, corr=10 | Same | Yes |
| Insp chore | susp=-5, insp=15 | Same | Yes |
| Corr chore | susp=10, corr=15 | Same | Yes |
| Confess | susp=20, insp=15 | Same | Yes |
| Pretend find | susp=10, insp=5, corr=15 | Same | Yes |
| Frame Missy | corr=20, trust_break | Same | Yes |
| Indulge night | susp=10, insp=5, corr=15 | Same | Yes |
| Ch1 write spend | insp=-10 | Same | Yes |
| Ch2 write spend | insp=-15 | Same | Yes |

## Implementation alignment

- **Router:** `end_slot(d2_reflect_done)` after afternoon desk retreat; `end_slot(d2_write_night)` after night; `day103_morning` deadline gate — matches MVP router contract.
- **Chains:** Optional afternoon menu uses `story.chain_available` / `resolve_chain_label` — consistent with Days 101–103.
- **Framework calls:** `check_confrontations`, `show_ledger_ui`, `set_time_period`, `has_story_fuel` — no ad hoc globals.
- **Continuity:** Handoff → Day 103 exit flags unchanged in substance.

## Voice check

| Character | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Cora (Day 2) | Interiority sharp; new spoken lines to Missy/superiors remain short and formal. Added humour lines are deadpan, not casual-modern. |
| Missy | Bright servant register; shock beats land. |
| Stern | Authority without volume; cutting economy. |
| Vance | Controlled fury; "private" beat serves class embarrassment. |
| Gideon (Day 2 Observer) | Cold precision; "Interesting choice" / investment framing preserved. |

## Editorial notes (non-blocking)

1. **Duplicate Stern reaction** in `day102_3_cora_pretends_to_find_it`: "eyes sharpen" and "mouth tightens" — intentional double beat (tension + humour); acceptable.
2. **Promotion sync:** When `prod_code_agent` promotes, merge router labels if `day102.rpy` still uses raw `resolve_turn()` + `jump day103_morning` — non-canon is router-forward per story_board.

## Notes for Victorian Consultant

- Verify "wrong shoes" metaphor and "filed" as interior idiom (not HR modernism).
- Confirm "Miss Vance" address from Gideon to Stern context.

## Resubmission gate

N/A — no `MUST FIX` blockers.
